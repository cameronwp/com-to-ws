# Analox Sub MK III F Simulator

This is built to parse data according to [its manual](<https://www.analoxsensortechnology.com/gfiles/Sub%20MkIIIF%20(ASF3)/8xx%20-%20Reference%20Documents/ASF3-800%20%20%20Sub%20MkIIIF%20User%20Manual%20.pdf>) (pg 51).

In case something ever happens to the manual, here's the relevant specification:

> PL1 COMM0 on each Operator Console provides an RS232 data output connection if
> it is required to capture and log the instrument status. No data connection
> should be made back to the Analox system to avoid interference from unexpected
> data sources. Data messages will typically be sent at least once every 5 seconds
> for each chamber, although this can be set to be 1s, 5s, 15s, 30s, 60s, 120s,
> 300s.

> All transmitted data is in ASCII printable characters, communicated at 9600
> baud, 1 start bit, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no hardware handshaking,
> with a terminating carriage return character (ASCII #13). A comma (#44) and a
> space character (#32) delimit each field within the message. Each message is
> preceded by a start character (>) and a date and time stamp. There is no comma
> between the date and time, as this allows the date and time field to be imported
> to an Excel spreadsheet as a combined date and time field. Each message contains
> a checksum to validate the data within the message. A 4 digit ASCII checksum
> (0000-FFFF hex) is intended as a straight summation of each of the characters in
> the message (excluding the checksum itself).
